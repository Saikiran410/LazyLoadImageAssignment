### To Reduce CLS(Cumulative Layout Shift)

-> Cumulative layout shift often comes down causes Unformatted images and dynamic
   advertisements

-> Can reduce by using aspect ratios on images,By including Width and Height
   size attributes on image elements.

-> If you unable add dimensions, estimate the aspect ratio & then use CSS property
    ‘object-fit: contain’ for a viable solution with no layout shift.

->  By reserving space for the ad slot ,Avoid collapsing ad space if there is no
    ad returned. Use a placeholder.
